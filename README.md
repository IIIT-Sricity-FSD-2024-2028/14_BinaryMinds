##  Problem Statement

Government licensing processes are often manual, slow, and lack transparency. Applicants face uncertainty in tracking their progress, while officers deal with disorganized paperwork and slow verification steps.

This system digitizes the entire lifecycle from the first click to the final license issuance making the process faster, clearer, and more accountable.

## Identified Actors
