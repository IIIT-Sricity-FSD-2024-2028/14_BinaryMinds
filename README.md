## Problem Statement

Traditional licensing mechanisms rely on manual documentation, disconnected verification stages, and limited lifecycle visibility. These limitations result in:

- Processing delays  
- Inconsistent validation  
- Weak accountability  
- Limited transparency  

A centralized digital system is required to enforce structured validation and ensure end-to-end traceability.

## Overview

The Digital Application Approval & Licensing Management System is an end-to-end e-Governance platform designed to manage the complete lifecycle of license and permit applications.

The system supports structured workflows for:

- Application Submission  
- Document Verification  
- Approval Decision  
- License Issuance  
- License Renewal  
- Compliance Monitoring  

It replaces fragmented paper-based processes with standardized, traceable, and accountable digital workflows.
